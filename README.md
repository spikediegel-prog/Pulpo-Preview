Pulpo is the governance and evidence plane between AI intelligence and consequential execution. It turns explicit intent into deterministic governance, binds allowed work to narrowly scoped one-use permits, and preserves durable evidence for verification and reconciliation.

This repository is the clean canonical Pulpo project. The older `Iron-Ember/pulpo` repository remains historical reference material; its accumulated plans, generated evidence, machine-specific scripts, and CI workarounds are intentionally not imported here.

## Proven now

The base dependency-free suite and optional asymmetric-authority suite prove:

- unknown, incomplete, and over-budget intents fail closed;
- selected high-impact actions require a verifier-backed approval envelope;
- authority policy pins verifier, key, algorithm, public-key fingerprint,
  deployment, and maximum approval lifetime;
- optional Ed25519 verification contains public material only and exposes no
  signer;
- caller-controlled boolean approval and authorization timestamps are absent
  from the evaluation API;
- permits are bound to the exact intent and cannot be replayed;
- an optional SQLite state backend preserves approval-ID, nonce, permit, and
  audit state across process restart in the same canonical kernel;
- persisted audit-chain tampering fails closed when the kernel restarts;
- configured agent roles cannot exceed their action, resource, or cost grant.
- a bounded domain order is bound to its full request, quote, reserved budget, and one-use permit.
- a configured external verifier checks v2 approval envelopes bound to trust,
  deployment, intent, policy, principal, session, nonce, issue time, and expiry
  using the kernel's trusted clock.
- transactional SQLite commerce state preserves reservations, attempted orders,
  reconciliation, and spend across restart.

PulpoGit provides a read-only clarity projection for local source state. It
distinguishes canonical, proposal, stale, diverged, detached, and dirty
checkouts without inferring tests or authority. See the
[PulpoGit clarity proof](proofs/git_clarity/README.md).

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Minimal example

```python
from pulpo import GovernanceKernel, Intent, Policy

kernel = GovernanceKernel(
    Policy(
        allowed_actions=frozenset({"read", "write"}),
        max_cost=100,
    )
)

intent = Intent("agent:builder", "write", "repo:README.md", cost=5)
decision = kernel.evaluate(intent)

if decision.outcome == "allow":
    assert kernel.consume(decision.permit, intent)
```

## Boundary

Pulpo currently proves governance, pinned asymmetric external-verifier contract
semantics, local restart-safe kernel replay state, and restart-durable bounded-
commerce state with dependency-free SQLite backends. It does not yet claim an
independently deployed human signer, trusted verifier bootstrap, rollback-proof
host storage, a real payment rail, network isolation, hostile-code sandboxing,
distributed identity, or production readiness.
