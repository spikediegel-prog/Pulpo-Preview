# Pulpo Preview — The Mad Lads Playground

Explore upcoming features, share experiments, and help shape what comes next. The Mad Lads Playground is our unofficial preview channel for testing and building excitement before official releases.

This branch in **spikediegel-prog/Pulpo-Preview** is an unofficial preview for testers. It contains unreleased upstream PRs awaiting review. It is not an official Pulpo release or a production-readiness claim. Source PRs remain open upstream, and their review/admission status is unchanged.

## Snapshot: 2026-10-03

**Verified selection:** 18 open, ready-for-review PR heads had all reported GitHub checks passing when inspected. Draft PRs, explicit holds, failed/pending/missing checks, and unverified heads are excluded. The check requirement applies to exact individual PR heads; it is not permission to weaken checks or bypass official review.

**Combined preview:** #230, #235, #237, #238, #249, #275, #276, #277, #289, #293, #294, #295.

**Separate testing only (merge conflicts):** #219, #236, #239, #250, #258, #267. Their exact passing heads are available on this fork as `preview-pr-<number>`. Conflicts were recorded and each merge aborted; no code was invented to resolve them.

Every eligible PR also has an exact-head `preview-pr-<number>` snapshot branch, including those already combined. These branches preserve individual-head provenance and should not be described as combined-preview equivalents.

The [machine-readable manifest](PREVIEW_MANIFEST.json) records PR titles, upstream links, exact commits, check counts, inclusion status, and conflict paths.

## Validation and boundaries

**Verified local execution:** the combined code at `60f73fb0fa04703e711a94d89662237cf93b403e` passed **445 tests**, warnings treated as errors, in 20.146s using Python 3.14.4 in a clean Linux clone under Ubuntu/WSL. [Captured log](perf-results/preview-unit-tests-20261003.log).

The first attempt in a Windows-created worktree had three Linux Git metadata errors; its result was not promoted to passing evidence. A separate Linux-native clone corrected the checkout boundary without changing source.

The preview adds only identification, provenance, and a fork preview CI trigger to the selected code. Full hosted preview workflows, Docker/container isolation, independent authority-service tests on this combination, physical hardware performance, external tester reproduction, and production containment remain **Unknown** until their own evidence exists. Passing individual-head checks do not prove interactions between PRs; 445 unit tests do not replace all workflow proofs.

The [Unofficial Preview Validation workflow](.github/workflows/preview-validation.yml) runs the existing CI jobs for pushes to `preview`; fork Actions may require enabling from the repository Actions tab. Consult this fork's latest run rather than assuming upstream results cover this combined head.

## Test this preview

```powershell
git clone --branch preview https://github.com/spikediegel-prog/Pulpo-Preview.git Pulpo-preview
cd Pulpo-preview
python -W error -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m pulpo.cli setup --json-report perf-results/pulpo-preview-setup.json
```

For an isolated PR, choose its snapshot at clone time, for example:

```powershell
git clone --branch preview-pr-295 https://github.com/spikediegel-prog/Pulpo-Preview.git Pulpo-pr-295
```

Record the checked-out commit, platform/Python/SQLite versions, full test log, reproduction steps, and expected/actual result when reporting a failure. Keep preview-specific failures separate from upstream recorded pre-existing failures. Windows filesystem/resource differences can matter; do not hide errors merely because a Linux run passed.

Official development and releases remain at [Ironnember/Pulpo1.0](https://github.com/Ironnember/Pulpo1.0). Your fork's `main` is not changed by this preview.

## Updating the preview

This is a dated snapshot, not an automatically updating channel. For the next snapshot: refresh upstream main and PR head/check evidence, reject drafts/holds and nonpassing checks, combine only compatible changes, rerun combined validation, and publish a new manifest. Preserve review and governance invariants throughout. Official merge/release approval remains separate.

Incremental SQL/component efficiency changes should be benchmarked and externally reproduced before stacking the next optimization. No governance invariant is weakened for performance. Do not execute live-provider ceremonies or supply production credentials merely to try this preview.

## Local-copy comparison and checkpoint update

See [local vs PR comparison](LOCAL_PR_COMPARISON.md). The local checkout is already included; no production source is replaced. A historical evidence-only tag supplies the exact checkpoint missing from the first hosted test run. That run failed, so consult the new hosted validation before claiming a green preview.
