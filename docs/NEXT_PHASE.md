# Pulpo Phase II — Operational Hardening and External Reproduction

Status: **Proposed phase contract / review required**

Phase entry point: protected `main` at `8e1aab5daaba55228189c994ddad5b86b5aed8ae` (PR #229).

## Purpose

Phase II converts Pulpo from a proof-rich advanced prototype into a smaller, admitted, externally reproducible consequence-authority system.

The phase objective is not more feature breadth.

The phase objective is:

> one current canonical chain in which independently established authority controls one exact real-world consequence, the intelligence lacks an alternate consequence path, independent evidence determines what happened, reconciliation binds reality back to authority, and another operator can reproduce the result.

The governing lifecycle remains:

`Purpose -> Intent -> Authority -> Policy -> Decision -> Permit -> Execution -> Evidence -> Reconciliation -> Memory -> Adaptation -> Purpose`

## Phase invariant

`PROOF_BREADTH != PROOF_FINALITY`

Pulpo already has substantial software and held external evidence. Phase II must reduce ambiguity and compose the strongest existing properties into one reproducible chain instead of opening additional proof families.

## Phase entry evidence

### Canonical

Protected `main` already contains:

- exact intent/policy authority evaluation;
- independently verifiable approval-envelope semantics;
- one-use permits and replay protection;
- durable restart/replay state;
- directive narrowing/revocation;
- capability activation as a separately governed transition;
- projection/memory non-elevation;
- capability-stripped Agent Plugin/MCP exposure;
- Secure MCP Tunnel software binding;
- independent evidence/reconciliation before verified consequence;
- governed outcome memory;
- exact execution-context binding;
- provider-derived GitHub execution-context attestation;
- Cloud SQL IAM connection and read-only cloud discovery software seams.

### Recorded external/runtime evidence

Held Stage-C V1 PR #165 records a real Supabase provider ceremony with:

- three distinct executor/observer/cleanup principals;
- complete frozen 10-family adversarial coverage;
- exactly one expected F07 provider effect;
- zero unauthorized provider effects under the frozen matrix;
- matched consequence reconciliation;
- cleanup reconciliation;
- evidence hashes and credential-clean scan;
- post-proof credential revocation.

Issue #90 records:

- HSM-backed external signer evidence;
- exact Cloud SQL/private-IAM software seam;
- one live Cloud Run execution that reached and queried the intended private Cloud SQL session before the acceptance receipt correctly failed closed on an invalid TLS observation;
- a corrected probe candidate awaiting a fresh governed execution.

### Pulpo Autonomous v0.2.0 cross-repository integration evidence

**Recorded:** external repository `spikediegel-prog/Pulpo-Autonomous` published
release `v0.2.0` at exact tag commit
`3d19259a4db74d1a0c54eba17737bd80c139ebe6` on 2026-09-21.

The Autonomous repository's own source-baseline document continues to designate
`Ironnember/Pulpo1.0` as the sole canonical Pulpo source and prohibits wholesale
legacy/fork import. The release is therefore evidence about portability and
composition, not a competing source of authority.

Useful transfer evidence includes:

- byte-identical `pulpo/network_exposure.py` with upstream candidate #238;
- byte-identical local-intelligence V2 proof implementation with #241;
- byte-identical core resource-limit and authority request-limit modules with #242;
- byte-identical narrowed custody-service Dockerfile with #244;
- byte-identical permit-expiry kernel tests with #243;
- a combined delta-audit / audit-fast-path / persistence integration that exercises
  the same core tamper, replay, restart, rollback, streaming verification, and
  delta-chain invariants represented by #246 and #248.

At the release tag, push CI succeeded for unit tests, network-exposure proof,
authority, authority-service, dependency-surface audit, hostile-worker custody,
hostile-worker container isolation, and the aggregate `test` gate.

The stronger boundary must remain explicit:

- the release is a mirror/port/synchronization of Pulpo1.0 hardening, not a
  clean-room independent implementation;
- it does not constitute a cold third-party reproduction of the complete
  consequential chain;
- the PR #11 integration head that became the release had a failed
  Constitutional Survival Proof: the randomized constitutional sequence passed,
  two mutation cases were killed, zero mutations survived, but 12 of 14 mutation
  cases were invalid because refactoring changed the mutation anchors;
- therefore exact-release Constitutional Survival is **not Verified** and the
  earlier green mutation run may not be transferred forward as exact-head proof.

Use v0.2.0 as cross-repository compatibility and integration evidence only.
Canonical Pulpo candidates still require their own exact-head CI, current
mutation-harness proof, independent review, and protected-main admission.

### Operational-hardening frontier

Current exact heads of PRs #236, #237, #238, #241, #242, #243, #244, #245, #246, #247, and #248 have CI and Constitutional Survival Proof evidence reported successful at reconciliation time.

These branches remain noncanonical until admitted.

## Phase workstreams

### A. Canonical admission train

Goal: turn the green hardening wave into one coherent canonical runtime without parallel truths.

Rules:

1. Rebase/restage each candidate on the current protected `main` immediately before final review when necessary.
2. Preserve exact-head CI and Constitutional Survival evidence.
3. Require the normal independent review/admission path.
4. Do not merge overlapping mechanisms independently merely because both are green.
5. After each admission, the next candidate must be reconciled against the new canonical head.
6. Do not weaken replay, audit, custody, fail-closed, or independent-evidence properties to improve performance or portability.

Priority classes:

**Security/runtime narrowing**
- #236 dependency auditing
- #237 outbound transport trust
- #238 zero unnecessary inbound listeners
- #241 prompt-injection containment through capability removal
- #242 untrusted-input/resource bounds
- #243 permit expiry
- #244 custody-container narrowing
- #245 HTTP probing admission

**Performance/scalability**
- #246 audit/delta/index optimization
- #248 unchanged-state audit-integrity fast path

**Portability**
- #247 Windows MCP snapshot loading
- #219 only to the extent it contains still-unrepresented portability behavior

### B. Overlap reconciliation

#### Semantic provenance — #239 vs #240

One primitive must be chosen or synthesized.

Required properties:

- provenance/evidence may narrow binding but never create authority;
- changed semantic/transcription lineage invalidates old approval where policy requires binding;
- human-readable approval presentation remains possible;
- legacy unbound intent identity remains explicit and testable;
- no second semantic governor or authority system is created.

Until reconciled:

`#239 + #240 != TWO_CANONICAL_TRUTHS`

#### Audit optimization — #246 vs #248

Pulpo Autonomous v0.2.0 is **Recorded integration evidence** that the delta-audit
and audit-integrity fast-path families can coexist in one broader tree while
ordinary CI remains green. It is not an upstream admission decision: the
release-side integration also exposed mutation-harness anchor drift, so the
canonical synthesis must update and pass the current constitutional mutation
harness rather than importing the combined fork state wholesale.

The admitted design must preserve one canonical audit truth.

Required properties:

- startup/restart performs the required historical integrity validation;
- out-of-band SQLite mutation invalidates any fast path and triggers revalidation;
- tampering fails closed;
- indexes/deltas/cache tokens remain non-authoritative acceleration structures;
- no checkpoint inside the same mutable trust domain may silently replace historical verification;
- measurable performance evidence is kept separate from correctness evidence.

#### Windows portability — #219 vs #247

Prefer the smallest current-main-derived implementation that preserves the existing filesystem trust boundary. Close or supersede redundant portability work after the chosen path is admitted.

## External-authority completion gate

Issue #90 is the highest-value unresolved authority boundary.

The next live acceptance step remains bounded:

1. freeze the corrected exact probe artifact derived from the current eligible #225 head;
2. record its source SHA and artifact/image digest;
3. freeze the exact Cloud Run job/image replacement object;
4. obtain explicit authority for that exact cloud mutation;
5. replace only the frozen image;
6. execute exactly one zero-retry probe;
7. evaluate the receipt using the corrected connector-transport model;
8. independently preserve and reconcile the resulting evidence;
9. do not bootstrap or widen authority state merely to make the probe pass.

Success at this gate proves only the accepted live private-IAM Cloud SQL runtime seam. It does not complete all of `authority.pulpo.ai`.

The remaining authority-service acceptance work must preserve separate human authority, HSM signing, durable state/evidence custody, origin/credential checks, replay/rollback/expiry denial, and external reproduction.

## Current-main Stage-C reproduction

The held Stage-C V1 result is evidence, not future authority.

After the authority boundary is accepted sufficiently for the target ceremony:

1. derive a fresh Stage-C candidate from current canonical `main`;
2. preserve the same or stricter adversarial contract;
3. create fresh disposable provider credentials;
4. keep executor, observer, and cleanup principals distinct;
5. prove the intelligence/worker lacks alternate provider capability under the tested topology;
6. execute the frozen adversarial matrix;
7. require zero unauthorized effects and the exact expected positive control;
8. independently observe provider reality;
9. reconcile matched consequence and cleanup;
10. revoke temporary credentials;
11. preserve a secret-clean evidence packet.

No historical permit, credential, approval, or authority transfers into the reproduction.

`PAST_SUCCESS != FUTURE_AUTHORITY`

## Customer-legible external consequence

After accepted authority and current-main Stage-C reproduction, execute one bounded external consequence that a non-builder can understand.

The candidate must be selected from an already-developed surface, not a new integration.

Candidate surfaces include:

- Telegram private test send;
- Name.com sandbox bounded order;
- payment sandbox proof.

Selection criteria:

- lowest consequence risk;
- exact object can be frozen and human-reviewed;
- intelligence can be denied direct provider credentials/capability;
- independent observation is possible;
- replay/unknown semantics are meaningful;
- evidence can be shared without secrets.

The consequence must follow:

`request -> exact object -> independent authority -> policy -> one-use permit -> capability custody -> execution -> independent observation -> reconciliation -> governed memory`

A provider response alone cannot satisfy the proof.

## Cold reproduction

Phase II does not exit on an internal success.

A cold reproducer must receive:

- exact canonical source SHA;
- dependency/environment manifest;
- exact frozen proof object and hashes;
- non-secret authority/public verification material;
- test/proof instructions;
- expected success and denial conditions;
- evidence verification procedure;
- explicit nonclaims.

The reproducer must not rely on undocumented builder knowledge or shared secret credentials.

A cold reproduction that cannot distinguish `success`, `mismatch`, and `unknown` is insufficient.

## Product freeze during Phase II

Until the phase exit criteria are met:

- no new authority system;
- no second router;
- no second executor;
- no second evidence ledger;
- no new memory governor;
- no new provider integration unless required to complete an existing phase proof;
- no product claim of production containment/readiness;
- no autonomous physical-system expansion inside Pulpo1.0.

New research may be recorded as an issue or design note, but it must not displace the phase-critical sequence.

## Phase exit criteria

Phase II is complete only when all of the following are true:

1. `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` reflects the actual canonical head and current claim boundary.
2. The selected hardening/performance/portability wave is admitted or explicitly rejected/superseded; no material duplicate mechanism remains ambiguous.
3. The independent authority runtime has an accepted bounded deployment receipt sufficient for the selected external consequence.
4. Stage-C or an equivalently strict consequence-custody proof is reproduced from current canonical Pulpo.
5. One customer-legible external consequence is executed through the same canonical authority/custody/evidence/reconciliation model.
6. Replay/reuse/restart/unknown cases do not recreate consequence authority.
7. The consequence is independently observed and reconciled.
8. A secret-clean evidence packet exists.
9. At least one independent operator cold-reproduces the complete bounded proof or identifies a falsifying discrepancy that is reconciled before the claim is restored.

Only then should Pulpo widen toward broader distribution, design-partner deployments, or packaged hardware.

## Company-level result if Phase II passes

The defensible claim becomes narrower and stronger:

> Pulpo is infrastructure for legitimate machine consequence. In the reproduced bounded workflow, intelligence could propose a real external effect but could not create that effect outside an independently authorized, exact, one-use, context-bound capability path; independent evidence determined what happened and reconciled the consequence back to its authority.

This remains a bounded proof, not a universal security claim.

## Doctrine

**Intelligence proposes. Governance disposes. Execution obeys. Evidence reports.**
